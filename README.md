# Creating global helper functions in sails.
This is part of a series of answers to common sails questions. 

Here’s the question: Hi I want to ask, if you could tell me where to put my helper functions, that I want to use in different Controllers. Should I create a custom config file for this purpose?

This repo is the project I used to answer the question. The screencast of the answer can be found [here](http://irlnathan.github.io/sailscasts/blog/2013/09/17/sailscasts-answers-ep2-how-do-i-create-a-global-helper-function-in-sails/).
